The course covers the mathematical foundation of all the techniques discussed and includes a diverse set of applications.  In particular, the course covers the utility of dimension reduction in the diagnostics of complex data, deterministic and stochastic reduced order modeling and their applications in optimization and uncertainty quantification."
